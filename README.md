# Follow Builders, Not Influencers

An AI-powered digest that tracks the top builders in AI — researchers, founders, PMs,
and engineers who are actually building things — and delivers curated summaries of
what they're saying.

**Philosophy:** Follow people who build products and have original opinions, not
influencers who regurgitate information.

## What You Get

A daily or weekly digest delivered to your preferred messaging app (Telegram, Discord,
WhatsApp, etc.) with:

- Summaries of new podcast episodes from top AI podcasts
- Key posts and insights from 25 curated AI builders on X/Twitter
- Links to all original content
- Available in English, Chinese, or bilingual

## Quick Start

1. Install the skill in your agent (OpenClaw or Claude Code)
2. Say "set up follow builders" or invoke `/follow-builders`
3. The agent walks you through setup conversationally — no config files to edit

The agent will ask you:
- How often you want your digest (daily or weekly) and what time
- What language you prefer
- How you want it delivered (Telegram, email, or in-chat)

Local-only mode: prompts and prepared feed files are read from your local checkout.
Nothing is pulled from a central GitHub feed or prompt source at runtime.
Your first digest arrives immediately after setup.

## Changing Settings

Your delivery preferences are configurable through conversation. Just tell your agent:

- "Switch to weekly digests on Monday mornings"
- "Change language to Chinese"
- "Make the summaries shorter"
- "Show me my current settings"

The source list (builders and podcasts) lives in your local checkout.
If you want changes, update your local repo or edit the config/source files yourself.

## Customizing the Summaries

The skill uses plain-English prompt files to control how content is summarized.
You can customize them two ways:

**Through conversation (recommended):**
Tell your agent what you want — "Make summaries more concise," "Focus on actionable
insights," "Use a more casual tone." The agent updates the prompts for you.

**Direct editing (power users):**
Edit the files in the `prompts/` folder:
- `summarize-podcast.md` — how podcast episodes are summarized
- `summarize-tweets.md` — how X/Twitter posts are summarized
- `digest-intro.md` — the overall digest format and tone
- `translate.md` — how English content is translated to Chinese

These are plain English instructions, not code. Changes take effect on the next digest.

## Installation

### OpenClaw
```bash
# From ClawhHub (coming soon)
clawhub install follow-builders

# Or manually
git clone https://github.com/zarazhangrui/follow-builders.git ~/skills/follow-builders
cd ~/skills/follow-builders/scripts && npm install
```

### Claude Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarazhangrui/follow-builders.git ~/.claude/skills/follow-builders
cd ~/.claude/skills/follow-builders/scripts && npm install
```

## Requirements

- An AI agent (OpenClaw, Claude Code, or similar)
- A local checkout of this repository
- Internet connection only if you choose to run the local feed generator against upstream APIs

Prompts and prepared feed files are read locally from this repo. Nothing in the
runtime digest path auto-fetches prompts or feeds from GitHub.

## How It Works

1. You keep local feed files in the repository (`feed-x.json` and `feed-podcasts.json`)
2. Your agent reads those local feed files and local prompt files from disk
3. Your agent remixes the raw content into a digestible summary using your preferences
4. The digest is delivered to your messaging app (or shown in-chat)

Optional: if you choose to run `scripts/generate-feed.js`, it can refresh those local
feed files from upstream APIs. That is a deliberate local action, not a silent runtime fetch.

See [examples/sample-digest.md](examples/sample-digest.md) for what the output looks like.

## Privacy

- Prompts and prepared feed files are loaded locally from your checkout
- If you use Telegram/email delivery, those keys are stored locally in `~/.follow-builders/.env`
- If you run the local feed generator, it will talk directly to the configured upstream APIs
- The skill only reads public content (public YouTube videos, public X posts)
- Your configuration, preferences, and reading history stay on your machine
